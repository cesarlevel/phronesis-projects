<h2>Project 25: Integrate Checkout.com dispute notifications</h2>
<h3>What made you smile?</h3>
<p>A few hints from my fellow team members.</p>
<h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
<p>Without hints or help we would not be able to do this.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>SUGGESTION</code>It appears that we need to create several documentation (case studies) pages that provide guidance on specific scenarios for the most important gateways. This will help to better guide merchants.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>SUGGESTION</code>As part of the process of adding new gateways it would be beneficial to create documentation for setting up and testing them in their sandbox environments.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>IMPROVEMENT</code>The email notifications event list is difficult to navigate. We should consider adding a filter to improve the search for the required event.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>BUG</code>The transaction canceled due to blocklist match event in the transaction details timeline does not expand. üêõ <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly/issues/9996">GitHub issue</a>

    </li>
    <li>
        <code>BUG</code>The loader should be limited to the email item when expanding it on the customer timeline, instead of affecting the entire page. üêõ <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly/issues/9995">GitHub issue</a>

    <li>
        <code>COMMENT</code>The email notifications were successfully triggered after setting up the email delivery address. However, we encountered a minor issue where the emails were being directed to the spam folder.

        During the setup of the 3DS option on the gateway account form, we observed a lack of visual indication for errors within the 3DS-related fields.

    </li>
    <li>
        The Sticky gateway feature made routing gateways testing a bit difficult.
    </li>
    <li>
        During 3DS testing with the Visa card, the approval flow functioned correctly, and the transaction was visible on both Recomm and Checkout.com. However, in the rejection flow, the transaction appeared on Recomm with the correct gateway message, but it did not appear on the Checkout.com dashboard.
