<h2>Project 15: Casino deposit 3ds</h2>
<h3>What made you smile?</h3>
<p>BankCountry filter worked</p>
<h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
<p>
    The documentation guided us on setting up the test just fine. The branching on 3DS was not very clear initially, as we used the filters
    on the gateway form page (bankCountry in CA) and no challange was happening on the deposit form. We did check on the transaction details page
    that the filter was working fine (even if we didn't know how exactly it worked under the hood which was a surprise as there are many option
    for countries in the filters) and the 3DS checked happened in a frictionless way. Took us a bit until we noticed in the documation that
    the only card that works to show the challange was an US one (BIN 41111).

        Link to <b>Test a generic 3DS flow</b> doesn't have an anchor tag for it, we should probably change it to #test-a-generic-offsite-approval-flow.

        It is possible to add any value in the filters select input this is probably useful in other filters, but not for things like a set of values.

        3DS messages on the deposit form shows the word players, we know this was specifically made for ITS but in the future
        we should consider if the form will only going to be use for casino players.

        Only the credit card with BIN 41111 will show the challange, there is no Canadian card that can show that flow
    </li>

        Canadian testing cards works fine for frictionless 3DS flows
    </li>
    <li>
        There is an issue with the 3DS challange page, in which the styles sent are preventing to see the challange text
        if the styles are on the dark mode side. Maybe we can wrap the 3DS challange part with an specific background.
