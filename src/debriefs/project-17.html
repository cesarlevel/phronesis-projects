<h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
<p>
    Other than not having a clear reference which methods are supported in this case eCheck, everything went well.
    Initially we were using ready to pay for the methods order but after reading a bit more the documentaiton we noticed the other event ready to payout
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        eCheck is not showing, seems like method is not yet implemented.
    </li>
</ul>
