<h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
<p>
    The only challenge was the lack of clear documentation on supported payment methods, specifically eCheck. Otherwise, the process went smoothly.<br />
    Initially, we relied on the "ready to pay" event for ordering payment methods, but after further review of the documentation, we discovered the "ready to payout" event.

<ul>
    <li>
        eCheck is not showing, seems like method is not yet implemented.
    </li>
</ul>
