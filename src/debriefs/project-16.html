<h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
<p>
    There was nothing particular very confusing as is very similar to the deposit request flow, so we have a good
    starting point, the only thing that blocked of for a few minutes was the enabling the gateway account to accepts
    payouts.

        The documentation preview example did not work as expected on Linux Firefox (132.0) due to CORS issues. However, when the example
        was opened on StackBlitz, the payout request was successfully made. Unfortunately, the Instruments became stuck in a loading state,
        preventing the payout request from being completed.

        Directly copying text from the code walkthrough component (excluding the copy to clipboard popup) can result in extra lines,
        which can be frustrating.

        The documentation's banner for enabling payout configuration on the gateway uses an info color, which is typically associated
        with optional information. It would be more effective to use a warning color to draw attention to this crucial step.
        Additionally, it is not included in the prerequisites list, which could lead to oversight.

        After completing the payout request, the result screen will display a link to redirect to the organization website. It is not possible
        to remove this link in Instruments.
