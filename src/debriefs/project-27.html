<h2>Project 27: Notify customers about trial ending</h2>
<h3>What made you smile?</h3>
<p>Email was sent gracefully.</p>
<h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
<p>The requirement to pay a setup fee before the trial could begin led to some confusion.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <fieldset>
            <legend><code>COMMENT</code></legend>
            Due to an initial setup error, we were unable to test the trial ending notification. However, the trial end invoice was successfully sent.
