<h2>Project 53: Free trials</h2>
<h3>What made you smile?</h3>
<p>The free trial can actually be set up and used.</p>
<h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
<p>Customer details timeline.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <fieldset>
            <legend><code>CONFUSION</code></legend>
            The timeline for the customer details can be confusing, there are a lot of different transactions happening and can be hard to understand. It is true that this is per gateway and there are gateways that can have a better "flow"

            Other than the timeline, the training went well with no issues.
