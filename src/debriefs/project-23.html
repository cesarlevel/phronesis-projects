<h2>Project 23: Integrate Checkout.com gateway</h2>
<h3>What made you smile?</h3>
<p>Very easy to integrate the gateway.</p>
<h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
<p>Finding the right information no the Checkout.com documentation.</p>

        Initially, the gateway integration failed due to the Secret API key not being configured with the processing channel ID. However, upon further review of the documentation, we successfully integrated the gateway by following the same steps used for services like Zoura. Notably, no additional settings were required beyond providing the secret API key during the Recomm gateway configuration.
